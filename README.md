# the-whole-bean-landing-page
I was given the prompt of creating a syle guide, logo and landing page design for a ficitional coffee shop called The Whole Bean
for my Visual Design class final project. I created the design in landing page design in Photoshop, the logo and menu/product icons
in Illustrator and the style guide in InDesign.

As a test of my developing skills, I decided to code up the site and make it responsive for viewing on multiple devices.
